# website

These are the content files for our website, written in Markdown.

The Wordpress editor is a pain to use, it randomly re-formats code snippets,
removes HTML and generally causes chaos, so we write all our content in real text  
editors like Atom and Sublime Text, then we copy it over from this repo to our site.

## Writing guidelines:

* All documents must be in Markdown.

* All images should use the HTML image tags with the appropriate
  Wordpress classes to align them in the center, as the images are on the same server
  (just copy the tags used for other pictures and edit the size and link).

* Italicize inline code instead of using the inline code tags, the theme we use
  makes inline code look awful.

## Post structure:

* Each section in a post should be its own separate post, except where that would
  be unnecessary, this makes navigation easier and pages load faster.

* The first post of a series of posts should be tagged `featured` so it comes up
  on the front page.

* Put a number before the posts names so finding the first or sixth or whichever
  one is easier.
