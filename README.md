# website

These are the content files for our website, written in Markdown.

The Wordpress editor is a pain to use, it randomly reformats code snippets,
removes HTML and generally causes chaos, so we write all our content in real text editors like 
githubs Atom and sublimetext, then we copy it over from this repo to our site.
