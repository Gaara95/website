# website

These are the content files for our website, written in Markdown.

The Wordpress editor is a pain to use, it randomly re-formats code snippets,
removes HTML and generally causes chaos, so we write all our content in real text  
editors like Atom and sublime text, then we copy it over from this repo to our site.
