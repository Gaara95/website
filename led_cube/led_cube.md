So for this project I wanted to make an LED cube, but as a "shield" for an Arduino
UNO, an Arduino shield is a board that plugs into the Arduinos pins and has
a bunch of circuitry on it, these are great when you want to add a complex thing
like a radio module to your Arduino, you just get a radio module shield and plug
it in no need to wire its pins to the Arduino with a breadboard.

Anyway, my finished cube looks like this:

You will need to have moderate soldering skills and about
2 to 3 hours to build this thing.

**Parts:**

* 27 diffused LEDs, don't use the clear ones like I did
* 3 2k resistors.
* A piece of perf board big enough for you Arduino.
* Wires.

**Tools:**

* A soldering iron and all the soldering stuff.
